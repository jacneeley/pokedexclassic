			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>This site is not mobile friendly.</p>
			<p>POKeDEX Classic is a web app that aims to recreate the original POKeDEX from GEN 1 (Red/Blue/Green/Yellow) that runs in the browser. </p>

			<h3 style="margin-top:-.5rem">Philosophy:</h3>
			<p>A fast, simple, responsive web app with little to no JS and no annoying cookies, trackers, etc.</p>
			<p>An almost 1:1 recreation - recreate the look and feel of the POKeDEX from the GEN 1 games with some creative liberaties taken for ease of development, accessibility, and or just because.</p>
			<p>Make something fun and cool - These days there's a lot of junk on the internet trying to sell you stuff. We need more junk sites that are just fun to use.</p>
			<h3>Disclaimers:</h3>
			<ul>1. I am NOT a POKeMON fan. I have played Diamond/Pearl & Emerald. That is it. I just like the aesthetics of the GEN 1 and the gameboy color.</ul>
			<ul>2. This is NOT a comprehensive database of POKeDEX. This is just a toy app for GEN 1. If you want a comprehensive DB check out <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">POKeAPI</a>.</ul>
